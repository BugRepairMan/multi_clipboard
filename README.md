# multi_clipboard

The program will save each piece of clipboard text under a keyword. For example, 
when you run ./mcb.pyw save spam, the current contents of the clipboard will 
be saved with the keyword spam. This text can later be loaded to the clipboard again 
by running ./mcb.pyw spam. And if the user forgets what keywords they have, 
they can run ./mcb.pyw list to copy a list of all keywords to the clipboard.
